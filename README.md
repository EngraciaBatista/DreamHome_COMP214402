Additional Guidelines 

 

Development Tools: Use any web-based front-end programming tool that can connect to the provided database or your own database. 

Coding Standards: Ensure clean coding practices, database interaction, and GUI features. 

Team Collaboration: Responsibilities should be shared among team members for different tasks (stored procedures, functions, GUI). 

Testing and Demonstration: Procedures and functions should be tested in SQL Developer and demonstrated successfully. 

User Interface: Design a user-friendly and possibly fancy GUI. 

 

Marking Guidelines 

 

Back-end Programming (Up to 70 points): Procedures, functions, and triggers must compile without errors and be tested successfully. 

Front-end GUI Effectiveness (0 up to 30 points): Assess the user-friendliness and design quality of the GUI. 

Presentation Skills: Evaluate eye contact, voice control, and body gestures during the presentation. 

This matrix will help in tracking the requirements and ensuring all aspects of the project are covered during the development and presentation phases. 

 

Back-end Development 

 

PL/SQL: 

This is Oracle's procedural extension for SQL. It is the best choice for writing stored procedures, functions, and triggers. 

Tool: SQL Developer (Oracle's integrated development environment). 

 

Front-end Development 

 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: 

For creating the web interface. HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 

Tools: Any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text) or IDE (e.g., WebStorm). 

Backend Framework: 

Node.js with Express: This setup allows you to build a web server and handle routes easily. It can also be used to interact with the Oracle database using the node-oracledb library. 

 

Database Connectivity 

 

Node.js with node-oracledb: 

This package allows Node.js applications to connect to Oracle databases, execute SQL queries, and call stored procedures. 

Tool: Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). 

 

Presentation 

 

PowerPoint: 

For creating and sharing the presentation with the instructor. 

Tool: Microsoft PowerPoint  

 

Suggested Setup and Workflow 

 

Database Setup: 

Use Oracle SQL Developer to create and test your PL/SQL procedures, functions, and triggers. 

Front-end Development: 

Design the forms and components for the various tasks (staff hiring, branch management, client management). 

Backend Development: 

Use Node.js and Express to create a server that handles API requests from the front-end. 

Use node-oracledb to connect your Node.js server to the Oracle database. 

Integration: 

Ensure that your front-end forms make AJAX requests to the backend API endpoints. 

The backend API should handle these requests, interact with the database (e.g., call PL/SQL procedures), and send back responses to the front-end. 

Testing: 

Thoroughly test all the functionalities in SQL Developer for back-end procedures. 

Test the front-end and back-end integration to ensure seamless data flow and error handling. 

Presentation: 

Prepare slides covering the project overview, architecture, technologies used, a demo of functionalities, and any challenges faced. 

Practice your presentation to ensure smooth delivery.
